# Credit Card Fraud Detection

A machine learning project to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using various classification algorithms.

## Project Overview

This project implements a fraud detection system that:
- Processes and analyzes credit card transaction data
- Engineers relevant features for fraud detection
- Trains and compares multiple machine learning models
- Provides a prediction system for real-time transaction screening

## Dataset

The dataset contains credit card transactions with the following characteristics:
- Features V1-V28: Principal components obtained from original transaction data
- 'Time': Seconds elapsed between transactions
- 'Amount': Transaction amount
- 'Class': Target variable (1 for fraud, 0 for normal)
